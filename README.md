----------------------------------------------

# How to Install?

To get `BXCPP` project, open your shell and type

	git clone https://github.com/harouwu/BXCPP.git

Use your `eclipse` to import our project from `existing file system`.
		
Run the project, the default input and argument is included.

---------------------------------------------

# How to use?

To change the input file, add filename as arguments in run configuration in `eclipse`.

see more help with `--help`.

# What is BXCPP?

`BXCPP` is a bidirectional preprocessor for C/CPP language based on an open source project [JCPP](http://www.anarres.org/projects/jcpp/ "Title"). 

It modeles `GCC` forward preprocessing. It accepts general changes given by most programming edit tools. It also makes backward transformation with replacements.

* `BXCPP` is based on a lightweight approach to handling the C preprocessor
  in program-editing tools based bidirectional transformations. We
  analyze different design alternatives and propose five requirements
  for defining the behavior of the backward transformation, including
  GETPUT and PUTGET
  
* We propose an algorithm that meets the five requirements. This
  algorithms is based on an interpretation of CPP as a set of
  rewriting rules, which structurally decomposes the
  bidirectionalization of CPP
  into the bidirectionalizatio of each rule
